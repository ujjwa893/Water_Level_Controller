# Water_Level_Controller
This system mainly works on a principle that “water conducts electricity”. The
four wires which are dipped into the tank will indicate the different water levels.
Based on the outputs of these wires, microcontroller displays water level on
LCD as well as controls the motor.
Initially when the tank is empty, LCD will display the message LOW and motor
runs automatically. When water level reaches to half level, now LCD displays
HALF and still motor runs.
When the tank is full, LCD displays FULL and motor automatically stops.
Again, the motor runs when water level in the tank becomes LOW.
